stackGallery
============
I have seen so many image gallery in so may website. i am still working with some other gallery

for this gallery 

you need createjs framework.. i have attached along with this..

what ever u need to used in the stack gallery. either it is image,movieclip or container 

you can add the code 

var slider = new imageStack(bitmapArray, stage, {x:500, y:400, width:600, height:350})

the last one is object atleast you want to use an empy bracket

bitmap array consits of loaded images or movieclips(note all the movieclip/images are loader by using this code itself)

x and y are the position the images 

width and height are the images height and width.( this will measure the regx,regy)
